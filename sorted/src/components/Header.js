            <p>I am an up-and-coming Software Engineer from Seattle, Wa. 
                After bartending for close to a decade, I realized it was time for a change when Covid-19 hit. 
                Since I've always had an affinity for computers, design, and technology, 
                I decided to dive into Software Development and become a Full Stack Engineer. 
                Take a look at what I've done below.
